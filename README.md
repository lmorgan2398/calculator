# calculator

My cumulative project for the Foundations Course of the Odin Project. 
This project involved the use of a wide variety of HTML elements, CSS 
properties, and general knowledge of Javascript script. The page is a fully 
functional calculator with instructions and a log of operations. There is 
keyboard functionality and the website has been formatted to render properly 
on computers as well as phones.
